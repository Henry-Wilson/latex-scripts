`sh` scripts to manage basic LaTeX docs for me

One must have the $DOCNAME variable independently set. I recommend doing this in BASHrc.
If you have confusion, read the comments in the scripts. They're pretty simple.

Essentially, startdoc makes a directory with a TeX template in it,
and superedit brings up all the windows we need to edit it efficiently.

You WILL need to edit this unless you have the same home directory structure as I do.
I may come back and make this general in the future.
